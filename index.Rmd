```

## Load interesting data

Let's load the EuStockMarkets data.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
df <- data.frame(date=as.matrix(time(EuStockMarkets)), EuStockMarkets)
stocks <- melt(df, "date", variable.name = "market", value.name = "points")
```

## Plotly

```{r, echo = FALSE}

fig <- plot_ly(stocks, x = ~date, y=~points, color = ~market, type = "scatter", mode = "lines")
fig
```

## Thanks for reviewing!
